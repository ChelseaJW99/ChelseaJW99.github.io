   <h2>Written Reflection</h2>
  <p>Reflecting on my Work-in-Progress 1 Submission, I am pleased on how my website is turning out so far. When first starting this project, I struggled to make and design the site effectively. However, through class time, office hours, and playing around with the inspect tool on other websites, I have been able to present a (work in progress) website that I am proud of. 
    </p>
    <p> I intend to use this website not only for class, but to add and improve the site even after the semester.  Designing and making my own website will allow me to show future employers writing samples and skills that I have learned in relation to digital media. Hoping to be in the field of Public Relations in the future, I will be expected to successfully help brand and market companies. This website is an opportunity for me to brand myself to employers.</p>
    <p> For the writing pieces included within my portfolio, I decided to give the rough / original drafts of the writing a gray background. This gives a clear indication that there is something to note about the writing and allows for a separation between the two pieces of writing on a page. I decided to give the original writing a light gray background to highlight the section, so the reader knows that something is different about that piece of writing. The writing samples that do not have a background color are the revised drafts. I decided to not give a background color or highlighting element to the revised versions of writing because I want these pieces to reflect how I envision my completed site to look as closely as possible. </p>
    <p> Writing wise, most of my revisions took place within my design concept. When I first wrote the assignment, I was unclear of what the prompt was asking, which led to me writing about a music blog that I wished to make from the github platform. After reconveing with the rest of the class, I realized that the class website had to be a portfolio and include certain elements such as a bio, work-in-progress-1, presentation, portfolio, etc. After that realization, I rewrote my design concept to mirror a portfolio. Personally, I described that I want a portfolio that is professional and clean, yet minimalistic and creative. I believe that my website has done what I said in my design concept as I kept the theme that I want in mind throughout. However, as we improve our sites, I wish to add pictures to give my website more color and look more creative than it currently does. I want to add pictures to my website after learning about photoshop and photo editing.</p>
    <p> In my bio, I made revisions in the layout of the text. At first, it was displayed on my website as a larger paragraph. Keeping most of the same info, I decided to split up the paragraph and change the language of some of the sentences. I thought that this would be beneficial in response to my site because I originally claimed that I wanted my website to be minimal and easy to navigate. Making the paragraphs smaller helps to make the information easier to read. Also, I believe applying this format style to writing within a website allows the site to reflect a more minimal and easygoing theme. </p>
    <p> The last writing assignment included on my site is the embedded fiction writing. I did not make many revisions to this where there were a few changes in sentence structure and grammar. For that reason, I decided to only include one finalized version of the writing, where the original did not have enough significant changes to include both. </p>
    <p> Moving forward in the class, I am excited to improve my web design skills and to continue to grow when it comes to the use of html and css. Specifically, I want to work more with these two platforms to allow for my website to include more design elements and creativity. Also, I am excited to learn about photoshop. Particularly, I am interested in learning how to improve a picture that isn't that good of quality. For example, learning about color balance and contrast within photoshop will allow for me to know how to make a picture more clear and higher quality. Something I look forward to / a learning goal that I have is how to decide web design aspects for a whole website. Additionally, I am excited to learn more about making specific themes and designs for companies. This particularly interests me because I wish to enter the field of public relations. Knowing how to make logos and design things for a company that fits well into an already branded company will be an important skill for me to know in the future. </p>
