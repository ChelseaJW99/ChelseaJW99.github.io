    <h2>Design Concept Writing</h2>
<p class="original">
(ORIGINAL) For my class website, I want it to be a music blog, where I discuss (mostly hip hop) songs of today and the past. With the blog, I will be able to review albums and lyrics of different artists and write creative posts about them. 
Also, I want to write articles about mainly everything revolving around hip hop music. Some potential menu sections that I would want to include within my blog are a section for different playlists that I have made, a 'pastiche' section where I talk about songs that have been sampled from older songs/hooks, an album section where I review albums as a whole, etc. 
With this in mind, I will need to have a unique brand that will present my information well while also appealing to an audience that has similar interests in music. The major themes that I want my blog to represent a clean and minimalistic vibe. 
When I say minimalist and clean, I want my website to be very easy to navigate, while having a modern and laid-back style. Some ways that I hope to do this are through having an easy to navigate menu section at the top of my website displaying different sections that I have stated above.
Although minimalist, I want my individual articles to include lots of pictures (whether it be of the artist or album cover of an album) to entertain the reader. Color schemes that I anticipate working with are black, white and greys, where most of my color will be coming from pictures. 
With these colors I hope for my blog to seem sleek and professional, yet not taken too seriously. Also, I want my website to be distant from my real life where I don't want to have an about me page and rather the writing be more "anonymous". A blog that I really like and would like to take design ideas from is Kourtney Kardashian's blog "Poosh". </p>
 </p>
<p> I want my website to embody a minimal and professional, yet creative overarching theme. I will keep this theme in mind when making design choices for my website. For instance, I will use font as a way to make sure that my website gives off minimal and professional design aspects. </p>
<p> Including a font that is standard like 'times' will help to give off this. However, I want to use a font that is a little different than the standard. At the same time, I don't want a font that is too out there. Also, I plan to use a basic color scheme to contribute a minimal theme within my website. Colors such as black, white, and greys are all colors that give off professionalism, but again are standard. Including standard colors will be representative of cleanliness and professionalism. Including these specific font and color elements, will help to portray a website that is classic and will not go out of style. </p>
<p> To go along with my theme of minimalism, I want my website to reflect this idea by being easy to navigate through. Including bold headers and organizing ideas that go together through styling and highlighting is a way to make my site more easy to navigate. Also, I will make my site easy to navigate by having more important information differentiated by the way it is styled (i.e bigger text, different color, bolded, italics). </p>
<p> To add a more creative element to my website, I want to add a lot of pictures. This will be where most of my color and creativity stems from within my website. I also want to use pictures as a way to link to other information. Some websites that have similar themes to the one stated above are sites such as "Vogue" and Kourtney Kardashian's blog "Poosh". I will be using these websites as a point of reference and inspiration for my site. </p>
