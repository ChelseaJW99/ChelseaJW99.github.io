For my class website, I want it to be a music blog, where I discuss (mostly hip hop) songs of today and the past. With the blog, I will be able to review albums and lyrics of different artists and write creative posts about them. 
Also, I want to write articles about mainly everything revolving around hip hop music. Some potential menu sections that I would want to include within my blog are a section for different playlists that I have made, a 'pastiche' section where I talk about songs that have been sampled from older songs/hooks, an album section where I review albums as a whole, etc. 
With this in mind, I will need to have a unique brand that will present my information well while also appealing to an audience that has similar interests in music. The major themes that I want my blog to represent a clean and minimalistic vibe. 
When I say minimalist and clean, I want my website to be very easy to navigate, while having a modern and laid-back style. Some ways that I hope to do this are through having an easy to navigate menu section at the top of my website displaying different sections that I have stated above.
Although minimalist, I want my individual articles to include lots of pictures (whether it be of the artist or album cover of an album) to entertain the reader. Color schemes that I anticipate working with are black, white and greys, where most of my color will be coming from pictures. 
With these colors I hope for my blog to seem sleek and professional, yet not taken too seriously. Also, I want my website to be distant from my real life where I don't want to have an about me page and rather the writing be more "anonymous". A blog that I really like and would like to take design ideas from is Kourtney Kardashian's blog "Poosh".
