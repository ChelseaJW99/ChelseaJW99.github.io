    <h2>Design Concept Writing</h2>

<p> I want my website to embody a minimal and professional, yet creative overarching theme. I will keep this theme in mind when making design choices for my website. For instance, I will use font as a way to make sure that my website gives off minimal and professional design aspects. </p>
<p> Including a font that is standard like 'times' will help to give off this. However, I want to use a font that is a little different than the standard. At the same time, I don't want a font that is too out there. Also, I plan to use a basic color scheme to contribute a minimal theme within my website. Colors such as black, white, and greys are all colors that give off professionalism, but again are standard. Including standard colors will be representative of cleanliness and professionalism. Including these specific font and color elements, will help to portray a website that is classic and will not go out of style. </p>
<p> To go along with my theme of minimalism, I want my website to reflect this idea by being easy to navigate through. Including bold headers and organizing ideas that go together through styling and highlighting is a way to make my site more easy to navigate. Also, I will make my site easy to navigate by having more important information differentiated by the way it is styled (i.e bigger text, different color, bolded, italics). </p>
<p> To add a more creative element to my website, I want to add a lot of pictures. This will be where most of my color and creativity stems from within my website. I also want to use pictures as a way to link to other information. Some websites that have similar themes to the one stated above are sites such as "Vogue" and Kourtney Kardashian's blog "Poosh". I will be using these websites as a point of reference and inspiration for my site. </p>
