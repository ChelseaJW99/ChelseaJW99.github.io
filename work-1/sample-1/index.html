FREE/ NEW COUCH!!!
Location: Pittsburgh, PA
 
I am selling a slightly used couch for $100! (the original price was close to $200) I’ve had the couch for less than 5 years and have decided that it is time for a change. 
The couch is pet and smoke friendly, but I can guarantee that the couch is in great / almost new condition. That being said, there is a slight rip on the left side of the couch, but is barely noticeable if you put a throw or pillow over it! 
Also, there’s a bit of a stain on the arm of the couch, but I can assure that the couch is close to clean. The couch needs to be picked up ASAP so you will have to come to my house and get it yourself (I work afternoons and nights, but any weekday before noon is a good time for pickup). 
I'm not sure of the exact measurements, but the couch is pretty large so it would be best to rent a truck or UHAUL for the day if you drive a smaller car. I live in the Altoona area, right outside of Pittsburgh for any students in the Pittsburgh area that may be interested. 
Feel free to message me with any questions or pictures!!
