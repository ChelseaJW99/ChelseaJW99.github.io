   <h2>Written Reflection 2</h2>
  <p>Overall, the completion of Work in Progress 2 gave me insight and helped to learn the basic tools within photoshop. Coming in with no experience, class time, linkedin videos and practice have helped to grasp major concepts within photoshop.

    <p> This first photoshop assignment was to change an old print advertisement. I chose to use photoshop to change an old crest ad. When first looking at the photo I knew that I wanted to change the crest toothpaste bottle in the child's hand into something else. The text at the top "Give your kids a fighting chance" resonated with me and prompted me to change the crest toothpaste in the child's hand to a syringe. I wanted the syringe coupled with the text and child to portray the message of pro vaccination. Pro vs Anti vaccination is a pretty popular debate as of lately. My changed print advertisement helps to show why I think vaccination is so important. Besides the importance of vaccination, the image of a child with a syringe made for a more gory theme to the photo. To play on this and experiment with different filters and colors within Photoshop, I decided to make the color scheme consist of blue red and yellow. Not only did this design choice add to my theme of the overall ad, but also made the ad stand out more. This first photoshop activity helped me get more acquainted with photoshop and specifically how to work with layers within photoshop.

    <p> For the genre mix assignment, my group was prompted to turn a movie in the romantic comedy genre into a disaster movie. Our group ended up choosing the movie "The Proposal" and switched up the movie poster to add a disaster effect. We kept the original actors Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds as the main component of the poster. We decided to mostly change the background to incorporate the disaster theme. In the background of the movie poster we added a fire explosion scene to add a sense of disaster. To add a dimension of disaster that went along with the theme of a 'proposal' and 'marriage' we added crying babies at the bottom of the poster. What could be more of a disaster than a bunch of crying babies? Through this assignment, we mostly worked with the background tool, while utilizing tools such as the laso and type tools. </p>
    <p>I used my storyboard assignment as an outline to my Pecha Kucha. Each slide represents a main point of my topic of top down lighting bias. Through my terrible drawing skills, I used the photoshop brush tools to draw different storyboard boxes to display key points in top down bias. Also, next to each drawing I included a short term/sentence to further explain the meaning behind the drawings.</p>
    <p>My logo assignment is based on a fake music streaming service, similar to apple music or spotify. The logo features a sound wave to convey that the company had something to do with sound. The company name "vibrations" was then incorporated into the soundwave where the words moved in a similar motion. With this assignment, I focused on and worked with text within photoshop. I wanted to make sure that my logo was clear, simple and fun.</p>
    <p>Speaking on my web design, I am still set on my original theme. As stated, I wanted my website to portray professionalism by maintaining a sleek and minimal design. A website that I wanted my website to resemble was Vogue. Something that I wanted to add to my website was image to give color to my website. Keeping my professional theme, I added a professional headshot before my welcome/bio. Adding the photoshop images also added a nice pop of color to different parts of the site. Also, something I wanted to change were the links on my portfolio. I didn't like how the links were so visibly link with a purple color and line underneath. This feature made me see the website as less sleak. To combat this, I removed the underlines under each link. However, in order to clearly show that they are in fact links, I keep the purplish color and the change of the cursor when the link is hovered over. Although I am satisfied with the designs in my website, I am ready to learn more in relation to digital media and improve within my site.</p>
