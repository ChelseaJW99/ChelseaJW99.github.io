    <p> 1. Soundscape Activity </p>
  <p> When reading over the description of the soundscape activity, the language "uncharted" and "imaginary" stuck in my head. I wanted to create a sound of a dystopian society where the location was under mass destruction. Specifically, my imaginary location would be somewhere that was tormented by a war of some sorts. With this idea in mind, I added eerie sounds, heavy rain and falling bombs to give hints towards a destruction within a dystopian society. However, I did not want my location to be all bad, where I wanted there to be a rebirth of the location at the end of the destruction. To achieve this, I decided to add a pause / quick moment of silence to transition over to a rebirth of the location. The "new" location after the destruction added peaceful nature sounds such as birds and soothing pond sounds with ducks. Using this sound allowed me to sublimely indicate an unchartered or imaginary location. </p>

  <p> 2. A choice related to genre or audience. </p> 
 <p> An example of how I made a choice related to genre or audience is seen in my revision of my embedded fiction writing. In the revision of my writing, I cut down my word count and made sure that my language was simple and more casual. These changes were important because of the audience of the writing. Specifically, the embedded fiction writing was meant to be seen on a social media platform where people sell things, such as Facebook Market. Due to this, it was important for me to realize that the audience wants to know the important information, instead of wasting their time reading flowery language. Another change that I included was adding an image to the writing. Because of the audience and platform that this writing is going on (social media) it is important to add visuals to keep the audience's attention. </p>

  <p> 3. A choice related to color, fonts, captions, scale, or other aspects of the visual mode. </p>
  <p> An example of a revision that I made in relation to visual mode is represented with the text on my website. For my paragraphs, I decided to center and change the margins so that all writing on my page would be more centered and uniform within my website. Centering all of the words and images on my website allowed for the information on my web page to be more prominent and stick out more for a reader on my webpage. Because I want my website to be professional, I decided to keep my font black and simple. If my website was under different circumstances, such as a more playful website I would reflect that with the color and font design of my paragraphs. Overall, for my final revision I made sure that my paragraphs were appealing to the eye, yet still professional and clean.</p>

  <p> 4. A choice related to comparing one thing to another. </p>
 <p> For my storyboard assignment, I made choices related to comparing one thing to another. In my first draft, I made my storyboard based off of my pecha kucha theme. In my revision, I compared my storyboard to my pecha kucha presentation. Comparing my storyboard to my presentation allowed for more in depth descriptions and images that related more to the descriptions of the main points of my Pecha Kucha theme. I chose this comparison because my presentation was a more detailed version of what I wanted my storyboard to entail. I do believe that with more revisions, my comparison would have been more effective. Specifically, more revisions would have allowed for me to include and draw more improved and detailed images to supplement my descriptions. </p>

  <p> 5. Something that frustrated me / took a longer amount of time than I would have liked. </p>
 <p> Something that frustrated me and took longer than expected was my overall website design. I had to make many revisions and edits to get my web design to look the way I wanted in the end. I overcome this obstacle by constantly reviewing and editing my html and css. Also, I sought help from my professor, Matt. By facing this obstacle, I learned that it is okay to ask for help from others. Also, I learned how tedious and important minor details can be within html and css coding. This obstacle also taught me how important it is to keep trying. There were many times when I was overly frustrated with the website design and wanted to give up. Overall, I am happy that I kept trying and was able to accomplish the finished design that I wanted. </p>

  <p> 6. Something I am particularly proud of. </p>
 <p> When asked to present something that I am particularly proud of, my revised logo sample stuck out in my mind. I am very proud of this work because I was able to utilize many of the skills within Photoshop that I learned within other photoshop samples. I am very proud of this photoshop sample because it looks like it could be used as an actual logo. The simplicity and general design fits in with a lot of logos that we learned about and were presented with in class. Also, I am particularly proud of my logo because it is clear that the brand or company of the "Vibrations" logo has to do with some aspect of sound or music. In future work, I can adapt the way I pay attention to minor design details and aspects to make the overall design successful. </p>
