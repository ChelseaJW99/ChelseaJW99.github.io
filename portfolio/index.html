    <p> 1. Soundscape Activity </p>
  <p> When reading over the description of the soundscape activity, the language "uncharted" and "imaginary" stuck in my head. I wanted to create a sound of a dystopian society where the location was under mass destruction. Specifically, my imaginary location would be somewhere that was tormented by a war of some sorts. With this idea in mind, I added eerie sounds, heavy rain and falling bombs to give hints towards a destruction within a dystopian society. However, I did not want my location to be all bad, where I wanted there to be a rebirth of the location at the end of the destruction. To achieve this, I decided to add a pause / quick moment of silence to transition over to a rebirth of the location. The "new" location after the destruction added peaceful nature sounds such as birds and soothing pond sounds with ducks. Using this sound allowed me to sublimely indicate an unchartered or imaginary location. </p>

  <p> 2. A choice related to genre or audience. </p> 
 <p> An example of how I made a choice related to genre or audience is seen in my revision of my embedded fiction writing. In the revision of my writing, I cut down my word count and made sure that my language was simple and more casual. These changes were important because of the audience of the writing. Specifically, the embedded fiction writing was meant to be seen on a social media platform where people sell things, such as Facebook Market. Due to this, it was important for me to realize that the audience wants to know the important information, instead of wasting their time reading flowery language. Another change that I included was adding an image to the writing. Because of the audience and platform that this writing is going on (social media) it is important to add visuals to keep the audience's attention. </p>

  <p> 3. A choice related to color, fonts, captions, scale, or other aspects of the visual mode. </p>
  <p> An example of a revision that I made in relation to visual mode is represented with the text on my website. For my paragraphs, I decided to center and change the margins so that all writing on my page would be more centered and uniform within my website. Centering all of the words and images on my website allowed for the information on my web page to be more prominent and stick out more for a reader on my webpage. Because I want my website to be professional, I decided to keep my font black and simple. If my website was under different circumstances, such as a more playful website I would reflect that with the color and font design of my paragraphs. Overall, for my final revision I made sure that my paragraphs were appealing to the eye, yet still professional and clean.</p>

    <p> 5. Something that frustrated me / took a longer amount of time than I would have liked. </p>
    <p> 6. Something I am particularly proud of. </p>
