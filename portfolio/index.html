        <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p> Hi world! My name is Chelsea Wyatt. I am from Central New Jersey, but currently reside in Pittsburgh. 
          I am studying Communications and Public and Professional Writing at the University of Pittsburgh. 
          With these majors in mind, I wish to enter the fields of Public Relations and Advertising. 
          Outside of class, I enjoy exploring the city of Pittsburgh through food and outings with friends. 
          Something I am truly passionate about is music. Don't let the previous sentence fool you. I
          can't sing or play an instrument, but that doesn't stop my passion. 
          In my free time you can find me creating playlists, watching music videos, and hosting listening parties.</p>
