  <h2>My Portfolio</h2>
  
  <p> At the beginning of the semester and the start of class, I had mixed emotions towards the course work that would be done. On one hand, I was excited to learn the material as I have never had experience with this information.  Also, I was excited because things learned in class could add beneficial skills towards my major and future career plans after graduation. On the other hand, I was nervous to start the course material because I struggle when it comes to things related to technology and computers. Also, as a writing major I was excited to see how my writing would translate into the digital sphere. An individual goal that I had for my reading and writing this term was to see how my reading and writing could translate to a digital platform. 
  </p>
  <p> During the completion of work in progress 1, I was very proud of myself. The design of my website is what I am most proud of because I knew absolutely nothing about HTML and CSS. Using HTML and CSS made me reflect on my editing process. Within my editing process, I carefully read over my codes and design and then changed things little by little until I finally designed something that I liked and was proud of. While editing, I had to consider the big picture while making minor details. For instance, when designing my website I had to constantly keep my overall design concept in mind when making edits. </p>
  <p> Personally, I believe that the most important component to the writing process is the outlining or the steps that are taken before the actual writing begins. Going through the course reinforced my views about outlining being an important part of the writing process. Specifically, I learned about assets and why it is important to "make a list of everything you'll need to compose your project" (Arola 105). Not only is outlining important, but having all of the necessary components available and ready before you begin writing helps to better your writing and also make it easier to complete. During my submissions and written reflections, I made sure that I knew all of the key components that I was going to write about before doing the actual writing. Similarly, with my website design, I made sure that I had all of my pictures, design ideas and writing samples ready before I began writing my codes for a page. Additionally, throughout the course I learned the importance of being aware of the audience and platform that I was appealing to. One area where I experimented with this was within the classwork samples within work in progress 1. For one classwork sample we were told to write an embedded fiction sample that could be used in a digital platform. I decided to write a parody of a post that would appear on Facebook, making fun of the idea of selling an old coach. This assignment and others alike taught me how to write for a specific audience and platform. For this particular assignment, I found that it was important to have a casual tone and simplistic language because of the audience that it would be received by. Because the platform that the writing was on, the overall voice of the writing had to be more casual. Something I will take away from this course is to pay attention to the audience and platform before completing a writing sample or project.

  <p> With the submission of work in progress 2, I was again excited yet nervous to learn photoshop. In the beginning, I struggled while using Photoshop, but I learned many techniques that I will be able to use outside of class. For one, Photoshop taught me the true importance of genres. In photoshop, I worked to change the genres of multiple pieces. While working on assignments in photoshop it was interesting to see how changing design choices can completely change something's genre and overall message and meaning. Specifically, this was seen in our partner movie poster assignment. My group was tasked with changing a romantic comedy movie poster into a disaster movie poster. In order to do this we added and deleted multiple design aspects from things as minor as color choice to aspects as major as backgrounds and language. 
  </p>
  <p> After completing a majority of my web design, I was excited to receive feedback from one of my peers. The peer review played a large role in my development as a reader, writer and thinker because it allowed for effective reconsideration of my work from someone else's point of view. Reading and working with peer revision made me "consider why reviewers responded in the way that they did and whether there are changes you can make so that you get the kind of reaction you were intending" (Arola 115). Essentially, The peer revision allowed me to revise my work from a different point of view and do things that I had not thought of. I was also able to realise why my peer suggested the revisions and why they were important. I believe that revision is editing something until it comes out the way you wish. Also revision can mean to build onto something until it is complete. I had to revise my classwork samples and overall website design many times to make sure that my website reflected myself and my vision for what I wanted to do. While revising it can be easy to stick to a clear end goal, so peer revision allows for you to revise things with a different point of view and include things that you did not think of yourself. 
  </p>
  <p> Now completing this course, I am extremely proud of myself. I am especially proud of learning the key concepts and techniques within html, css, photoshop and audacity. However, I believe that I can work with and improve within all of these platforms. Specifically, I want to work and learn more about photoshop in the future. I really enjoyed working with different combinations of modes "modality - that creates the full piece of communication" (Arola). All of my modes of communication, such as my images, writing and design choices all work together to make up the final portfolio and communicate my learned skill to the viewers of my website. My imagined audience for my portfolio are future employers. I expect for my audience to have an appreciation and be impressed with the hard work that I put into my website, classwork samples and design.

    <p> 1. Soundscape Activity </p>
  <p> When reading over the description of the soundscape activity, the language "uncharted" and "imaginary" stuck in my head. I wanted to create a sound of a dystopian society where the location was under mass destruction. Specifically, my imaginary location would be somewhere that was tormented by a war of some sorts. With this idea in mind, I added eerie sounds, heavy rain and falling bombs to give hints towards a destruction within a dystopian society. However, I did not want my location to be all bad, where I wanted there to be a rebirth of the location at the end of the destruction. To achieve this, I decided to add a pause / quick moment of silence to transition over to a rebirth of the location. The "new" location after the destruction added peaceful nature sounds such as birds and soothing pond sounds with ducks. Using this sound allowed me to sublimely indicate an unchartered or imaginary location. </p>

  <p> 2. A choice related to genre or audience. </p> 
 <p> An example of how I made a choice related to genre or audience is seen in my revision of my embedded fiction writing. In the revision of my writing, I cut down my word count and made sure that my language was simple and more casual. These changes were important because of the audience of the writing. Specifically, the embedded fiction writing was meant to be seen on a social media platform where people sell things, such as Facebook Market. Due to this, it was important for me to realize that the audience wants to know the important information, instead of wasting their time reading flowery language. Another change that I included was adding an image to the writing. Because of the audience and platform that this writing is going on (social media) it is important to add visuals to keep the audience's attention. </p>

  <p> 3. A choice related to color, fonts, captions, scale, or other aspects of the visual mode. </p>
  <p> An example of a revision that I made in relation to visual mode is represented with the text on my website. For my paragraphs, I decided to center and change the margins so that all writing on my page would be more centered and uniform within my website. Centering all of the words and images on my website allowed for the information on my web page to be more prominent and stick out more for a reader on my webpage. Because I want my website to be professional, I decided to keep my font black and simple. If my website was under different circumstances, such as a more playful website I would reflect that with the color and font design of my paragraphs. Overall, for my final revision I made sure that my paragraphs were appealing to the eye, yet still professional and clean.</p>

  <p> 4. A choice related to comparing one thing to another. </p>
 <p> For my storyboard assignment, I made choices related to comparing one thing to another. In my first draft, I made my storyboard based off of my pecha kucha theme. In my revision, I compared my storyboard to my pecha kucha presentation. Comparing my storyboard to my presentation allowed for more in depth descriptions and images that related more to the descriptions of the main points of my Pecha Kucha theme. I chose this comparison because my presentation was a more detailed version of what I wanted my storyboard to entail. I do believe that with more revisions, my comparison would have been more effective. Specifically, more revisions would have allowed for me to include and draw more improved and detailed images to supplement my descriptions. </p>

  <p> 5. Something that frustrated me / took a longer amount of time than I would have liked. </p>
 <p> Something that frustrated me and took longer than expected was my overall website design. I had to make many revisions and edits to get my web design to look the way I wanted in the end. I overcome this obstacle by constantly reviewing and editing my html and css. Also, I sought help from my professor, Matt. By facing this obstacle, I learned that it is okay to ask for help from others. Also, I learned how tedious and important minor details can be within html and css coding. This obstacle also taught me how important it is to keep trying. There were many times when I was overly frustrated with the website design and wanted to give up. Overall, I am happy that I kept trying and was able to accomplish the finished design that I wanted. </p>

  <p> 6. Something I am particularly proud of. </p>
 <p> When asked to present something that I am particularly proud of, my revised logo sample stuck out in my mind. I am very proud of this work because I was able to utilize many of the skills within Photoshop that I learned within other photoshop samples. I am very proud of this photoshop sample because it looks like it could be used as an actual logo. The simplicity and general design fits in with a lot of logos that we learned about and were presented with in class. Also, I am particularly proud of my logo because it is clear that the brand or company of the "Vibrations" logo has to do with some aspect of sound or music. In future work, I can adapt the way I pay attention to minor design details and aspects to make the overall design successful. </p>
