        <p class="original"> (ORIGINAL)Hi world! My name is Chelsea Wyatt. I am from Central New Jersey, but currently reside in Pittsburgh. 
          I am studying Communications and Public and Professional Writing at the University of Pittsburgh. 
          With these majors in mind, I wish to enter the fields of Public Relations and Advertising. 
          Outside of class, I enjoy exploring the city of Pittsburgh through food and outings with friends. 
          Something I am truly passionate about is music. Don't let the previous sentence fool you. I
          can't sing or play an instrument, but that doesn't stop my passion. 
          In my free time you can find me creating playlists, watching music videos, and hosting listening parties. </p>
        <p> Hi world! Welcome to my virtual Portfolio. My name is Chelsea Wyatt and I am a Junior at the University of Pittsburgh. 
            Originally from Marlboro, NJ, I currently reside in Pittsburgh where I study Communication Rhetoric and Public and Professional Writing at the University. 
            With these majors, I wish to immerse myself within the fields of Public Relations and Advertising. </p>
        <p> Outside of the classroom, I try to take full advantage of the city of Pittsburgh where I like to explore through food and outings with friends. 
          Also, something to know about me is my passion for music. Don't let the previous sentence fool you. I don't play any instruments or sing, my passion is still strong. 
          In my free time you can find me creating playlists, watching music videos, and hosting listening parties for newly released music. 
          I also love listening and writing about music, and plan to start a music blog with the new found skills that will be learned from my digital media class. </p>
       <p> I wish to use this blog as an avenue to display all of my work and writing that I have completed inside and outside of the classroom. 
         This blog will allow me to showcase my writing skills, creativity, and use of html and css. </p>
